## Lab 00 - 3D Cube
Given the Lab00 setup, modify it to:  
- [x] draw a single cube
- [x] change the color to be applied to each face instead of vertex
- [x] add scaling commands with mouse buttons 

## Lab 01 - 2D Bézier Curves
Given the Lab01 setup, modify it to:
- [x] draw Bézier curve with the de Casteljau algorithm
- [x] drag control points to change their position
- [x] draw Bézier curve with the optimized adaptive subdivision method

## Lab 02 - 2D CoronaGame
- [ ] lose condition: last lane of viruses reaches the ship
- [x] Q+SPACE for strong attack with cooldown
- [x] change viruses's look
