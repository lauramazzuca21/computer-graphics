Lab excercises for the Foundations of Computer Graphics exam.  

## Lab 00 - 3D Cube
Given the Lab00 setup, modify it to:  
- [x] draw a single cube
- [x] change the color to be applied to each face instead of vertex
- [x] add scaling commands with mouse buttons 

## Lab 01 - 2D Bézier Curves
Given the Lab01 setup, modify it to:
- [x] draw Bézier curve with the de Casteljau algorithm
- [x] drag control points to change their position
- [x] draw Bézier curve with the optimized adaptive subdivision method

## Lab 02 - 2D CoronaGame
- [ ] lose condition: last lane of viruses reaches the ship
- [x] Q+SPACE for strong attack with cooldown
- [x] change viruses's look

## Lab 03 - 3D Polygonal Meshes Scene Control
Given the Lab03 setup, modify it to:
- [ ] compute and store normal vectors of polygonal meshes' vertex
- [ ] create a new material
- [x] create Wave Motion in ```v_wave.glsl``` vertex shader
- [ ] create Toon Shading in ```v_toon.glsl``` and ```f_toon.glsl```
- [ ] add pan horizontal camera navigation
- [ ] add single object selection throught left/right arrows
- [ ] enable transformations (rotate - r key, scale - s key, translate - g key) for single objects in the scene...
- [ ] wrt either WCS or OCS (pop-up menu to choose which one)
- [ ] enable axis choice on keyboard
- [ ] enable translation of Light object
- [ ] wheel up/down to increase/decrease transformation
